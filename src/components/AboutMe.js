              I am an Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer with
              experience in designing electronic systems, 3D modeling, and
              programming microcontrollers, especially in C and using Arduino
              IDE. Throughout my journey, I have combined these skills with web
              development, enabling me to create comprehensive solutions that
              integrate hardware and software.

              As a Full-Stack Developer, I excel in frontend technologies like
              React.js, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, as well as backend tools like
              Node.js and SQL. Additionally, I have experience in Python for
              data analysis and automation. My focus is always on creating
              functional, efficient, and well-designed projects.

              perfecting every project I work on. I believe in the importance of
              organization, efficiency, and lifelong learning to grow both
              personally and professionally.
